## Json file merger

The scipt merges multiple json files into one. It requires all files to be merged into one directory. 

You can keep the script in the same directory and run it without any arguments.

However, if you wish to merge multiple files from another directory you can pass it as a command line argument.

```bash
$python jsonmerge.py -d //directory_path
```
